Some other imp ?
1. Difference between java and javascript ?
2. what is hosting?



7/9/23 

1. What is Javascript? 
 ->  it is scripting language which is use to add functionality or action into website or web application.
     it is loosely typed language.
     it is interpreted language. 
     Javascript is object base language. in Javascript window is globle object.
       


2. Why js is interpeterd  language?
 ->   javascript has no compilation step> insted an interpreter in the browser reads over
      the javascript code, interpreded each line and runs it.


3. Why js is loosesly typed language?
->  because in javascript we diclare string in " " or '' when we diclare string in "" it will 
    string and when we declared string'' in singke code its also a string thas why javascript 
    is lossely typed language.


4. How Many Ways to use javascript in html page?
  -> There are two ways to use js 
      1.Internal js :- in html pahe first we write script tag and in that we write js code.
      2.External js :- in this we create a seperate js file and import that js file in html 
                       file by using script.


5. How to get output in Javascript
      1.document.write()            :- it will display output on browser.
      2.window.alert()              :- it will generate one popup window and display output in it.
      3.console.log()               :- it will display output in browser console.
      4.DOM(document Object Model)  :- it is use to manipulate DOM element and display output inside specific element. 

6. What is Variable ?
    -variable it use to store data in it.
    -it is like container in which we can store any type of data.
    -in js variable can create with var, let and const keyword.
            (var,let,const) - let and var are es6 new variable

 syntax:     var variableName;        // variable declaration 
             variableName = data;    // variable initialization.  
 
7. What is the rules of variable      
-> Rules:
     -variable name can not be any reserved keyword.
     -variable name can not start with digit.
     -variable name start with lowercase letter.
     -variable name can start with alphanumeric, $ and _;

8. data types in js 
-primitive data type or inbuilt data type 
    1.number   : 1,2,3
    2.string   : "" or ''
    3.boolean  : true or false ;
    4.undefine : not defined
    5.null     : variable with empt data;

-nonprimitive data type or user define data type 
6.array 
7.object 

// Data types in js

      1. number data type
      var num1 = 100;
      var num2 = 0.5;
      var num3 = 2424235344;

      2. string data type
      var yourName = "Sanket";
      var friendName = "Devanand";
      var myData = "123";

      3. Boolean
      var cond1 = true;
      var cond2 = false;

      4. undefine
      var city;

      5.null data type
      var state = null;

      6.array data type []
      var students = ["Aakash", "Pradnya", "Rahul"];

      7. object data type {}
      var emp = { id: 101, name: "Pooja", salary: 95000 };

⁮ Operators

1.Arithmatic operator : 
+ , - , * , / , % , ** , ++ , --

/ (division)         : it return us quotient 
% (modulus)          : it return us remainder 
** (exponentiation)  : it return power of any number.

2.Relational operator:  all relation operator return us boolean data 
> , < , >= , <= , != ,== , === 

== (equal to):            it will only value if values are same then it return true.
=== (exactly equal to):   it will check both value as well as it data type if both are same then it return true.


3.Logical operator :     operator return us boolean data 
OR (||) ,AND (&&) ,NOT (!)


! What is Function ?
     -it is a block of code which is use to perform specific operation.
     -Function will execute only when we call it. 
     -Function can be reuse multiple time. 

          syntax:   function functionName(){
                        /// code 
                  }

! Which Are The Type Of Function Js ?
   -in Javascript we have mainly two types of function. 
      1.Inbuilt function : function provide by Javascript.
      2.User define function : function which is created by user. 

again four types 
1. function with no argument and no return value; 
2. function with argument but no return value;
3. function with no argument but with return value ;
4. function with argument and with return value; 


! what is prompt
:- it is inbuilt method which generate one popup window and allows us to get input value from user 
      like we want number from user for adding that time we use prompt 

task : get first name and last name by using prompt and display friendName in red color and lname in blue color on window

*Conditional statement : if we want to execute code conditionaly then for that we use it.

1.if : if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise not 
          syntax:     if(condition){
                      ////code 
                      }

2.if else:  if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else block will get execute
                        syntax:    if(condition){
                                   //// true part
                                   }else{
                                   /// false part 
                                   }

*Nested if else : in this we write if and else block inside another  if block 

                    synatx:  if (condition){
                            ^
                           !      if(condition){
                          !                 true part;
                         !           }else{
                        !                   false part
                       !              }
                      !              
                      ----------> }else{
                                  //false part
                                   }

*Switch statement : when we have one option and multiple choice in that case we use it. 
                              syntax:   
                                  switch(choice){
                                    case 1:{
                                      ///code;
                                      break;
                                    }
                                    case 2:{
                                       ///code;
                                      break;
                                    }
                                    .
                                    .
                                    .
                                    default:{
                                       ///code;
                                      break;
                                    }
                                  }

*Looping Statment: if you want to reapte same thing multipe time for that we use looping statment
-there three types of looping 
1.for loop : it has three expresion in it. 
   -1. initialization     
   -2.condition-check  
   -3.increment/decrement 
   -if the condition is true then and only then block will execute.

   syntax:  for(initialization;condition-check;increment/decrement){
              code to execute 
         }

2.while loop : it has three expresion in it. 
   -1. initialization,2.condition-check, 3.increment/decrement 
   -if the condition is true then and only then block will execute.

   syntax: 
        initialization;
    while(condition-check;){
              code to execute ;
              increment/decrement
         }

3.do while :it has three expresion in it. 
   -1. initialization,2.condition-check, 3.increment/decrement 
   -if the condition is true then and only then block will execute.
   -even though condition is false code execute once.

syntax: initialization;
       do{
        //code
        increment/decrement 
       }while(condition-check)

*Array : 
-it is use to store multipe values in single variable with same data type.
-it store value or data on index basis.
-array index always start from zero index 
-we can access array data outside array by writting arrayName[index];
-array represented by []

-In Javascript Mainly we have two types of Function 

1.Inbuilt Function : function which is already developed. and which we can use
2.User Define Function : function developed by user

-it is block of code which use to perform specific task.
-it will execute only when we call it.
-function can be re-use multipe time.

@ What is Typecasting ?
-> whenever you get data from input element it return data in string formate.
    TypeCasting: converting one datatype to another is called typecasting 

*Object:
     - it is use to store multipe values with different datatype.
     - in object data store in key and value pairs 
     - we can access object data outside object by writting objectName.keyName 
     - object represented by {}

*string :-it is collection of character 
         - it always write in "" or '' 
         -in string every letter has index number and index number start from 0 index 
         -in string blank space is also consider as string. 

*there are three methode which gives us index number of searching string

1.indexOf(searching-string, index number) :
-it return index number of first occurences of searching string .
-it start searching of string from left to right.
-it take two parameter 1.searching-string, 2.index number.
-if searching string is not found then it will return -1. 

2.lastIndexOf(searching-string, index number):
-it return index number of first occurences of searching string .
-it start searching of string from right to left.
-it take two parameter 1.searching-string, 2.index number.
-if searching string is not found then it will return -1.

3.search(searching-string):
-it return index number of first occurences of searching string .
-it start searching of string from left to right.
-it take one parameter 1.searching-string.
-if searching string is not found then it will return -1. 
-it is faster than indexOf method

          -if we write +ve index then it will search string from left to right 
          -if we write -ve index then it will search string from right to left 

5.subString(start-index,End-index): it will return part of string from given string 
          -it will take two parameter 1. start index,2. End-index 
          -in this we write only +ve index then it will search string from left to right 
          
6.substr(start index,total-number of character):it will return part of string from given string

What is synchronus and asynchronous in Javascript-
-Javascript is by default asynchronous in nature.
-it work on single thread 

synchronus :  as the name suggests synchronus means to be in a sequence 
asynchronous:

setInterval: it call another methode for multiple time after given time.
setTimeOut: it call another method only once after perticular time.  
-when we pass a function as parameter in anotherr function in that case we do write parenthesis for inner function

ES6(2015):

1.Variable Declaration

 let,const :- it is use to ceate a block scope variable 

 var :    -it is use to create a function scope variable 
          -it can be re-declare.
          -it can be use before declaration.

 let :   -it is use to create a block scope variable.
        -it can not be re-declare 
        -it can not be use before declaration

 const : -it is use to create a block scope constant variable.
        -it can not re-declare.
        -when we create it at same time we have to initialize it. 
        -it value never change at run time.
        -it can not be use before declaration.



2.What is hoisting :
    -it is Javascript default behaviour which moves variable declaration automatically at top.

3.what is "use strict" 
   -it is es5 feature 
   -it execute Javascript code in strict mode 
   -it always at top of page 

4.trim(): it remove unwanted wide space from both side of string.

2.OOPs(Object Oriented Programings) :
    -to provide security 
    -to perform code reusability 
    -reduce line of code.
    -eassy to maintain 

Feature of Oops 
1.class :
    -it is collection of data-member and member function.
    -it is template which we can reuse.
    -to create class we have use class keyword.
    -class name must start with capital letter 

    *this: it act as owner of class 
        -as well as it represent current class .
        
2.constructor: 
     -it is special member function of class.
     -in Javascript constructor name must be constructor only.
     -constructor will execute automatically when an class object is created or initialize.


3.Object:
     -it is an instance of class.
     -with the help of object we can access class data-member and member-function outside class.

OPPs():-
1.Inheritance :
    -it allows us to access parent class properties into child class.
    -to perform Inheritance we have to  extends child class from parent class.
    -parent class is also called super class and child class sub class 

2.abstraction:
    -Hidding unnecessary data from user.

3.encapsulation : 
    -wrapping of Data into single unit.

4.pollymorphism :
    -it is ability to take more than one form.

  @ method over-loading: when we have multiple method with same in name in same class is called as method overloading. 
  @ method over-ridding :    when we have multiple method with same name in different class is called as method over-ridding.

*static: 
    -static datamember can not be access outside class by using class object.
    -we can access static datamember outside class by using classname.propertyName.

*module concept :
   -it is simple or complex Javascript logic written in single of multipe Javascript file.
    to reuse it. 
   -to use module we have to use export and import statement
   -export :it is use to send data from a file.
   -import : it is use to access data from another file.

*destructuring:
   -creating a constant variable and storing data init it.
   -we can destruture array as well as object also.
   -while destructuring object variable must be same as keyName available in object.
